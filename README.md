Fair resource allocation

For this small project started during the Covid 19 pandemic, we wanted to imagine we were a business who produced PPE equipment and that we had a method to fairly allocate the PPE equipment to those who requested it.

So we made up axioms about our business.

1. As a business, we can make 3 boxes of PPE a day.
2. We can make three different types of PPE; circle, triangle and square.
3. Any type of PPE can be made in any slot.
4. We want to accept orders for PPE equipment.
5. We want to eventually and consistently confirm who is getting which box on which day.
